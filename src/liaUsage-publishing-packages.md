# Publishing packages


## `Publishing packages not ready`



---

For publishing packages, you need to register to [lia](https://lia.ellie-lang.org).

~~After registering, you can get your [api key](https://lia.ellie-lang.org/api-key) and save it by running the following command:~~

_`Lia cannot serve any packages right now`_

```sh
lia config set api-key <api-key>
```

After that, you can publish your package by running the following command:

```sh
lia publish
```
